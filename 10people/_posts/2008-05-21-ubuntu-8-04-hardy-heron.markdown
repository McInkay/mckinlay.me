Ok, so I thought I would give my thoughts on the new Ubuntu that came out at the end of last month. I would like to point out that I haven’t actually upgraded my main machine to Hardy because I have a very slow internet connection, and have ordered some cds to upgrade from. I did, however, upgrade one machine, and a guy who I work with is also using it, so I think I am able to comment on it now.

First of all, I have been hearing many a complaint about the WUBI install. Reading the forums seem to bring up a lot of complaints about suddenly not being able to boot into Ubuntu, and it drops you into a BusyBox shell. I had never heard of BusyBox, but it seems to be a much less feature-rich shell than bash, and is brought up when even bash cannot be started. As far as I can see, there is no fix for this, but it seems to be popping up a bit.

My drivers seem to be pretty much the same as in 7.10, all but the graphics driver work out the box, but only a small amount of tweaking and everything works fine.

One thing I really like about this new release is the new clock applet. I really like it, mainly because of the world clock bit, and the map. I’m not sure why, it just makes me smile.

Pulse audio is an interesting new feature in Hardy. I’ve not had time to fully check it out, but it sounds quite nice. I’m not sure what new features it brings to my computer as apposed to ALSA, but I shall look up on it and see what it can do.

One problem I am having with Hardy, is the fact that there are so many new features in Ubuntu, many quite buggy, but it is an LTS release. To be honest, I would think that they would try and make it as stable as possible, and if that means leaving new features out, so be it. Bring them into 8.10 when they are better. But then again, everyone likes new features.

So that is my thought on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Hardy Heron. I shall play with it a bit more, and come back on some more of the features.

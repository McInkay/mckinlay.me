I have just let loose the first part in my site/blog revamping. This is my new theme. There are some tweaks I still need to do, and it is not finished, so if you see anything that doesn’t look nice, or you can’t see etc, let me know. There are a few things about it that I don’t like, but if I release it, it means I’ll get these things ironed out quicker. Let me know your opinions etc. Yes, I know you can’t read the tag cloud just now, it is meant to be white, but for some reason it seems to be taking the theme’s text colour, which is very odd as it isn’t designed to do this.

But anyway, let me know what you think. My next step is reorganising my categories, then getting my second blog up and running, and finally my 3rd site, the “other” site which will include all the stuff that just disappeared from this blog (it is still there, the links are just gone, I want it to be simpler and less cluttered), and then I will be done. Hopefully I will have it all done by the time I leave in June for the summer.

Comments will be very welcome on my new theme. I know its not perfect, I already have noticed bits that don’t seem nice with content now in it (things always look different without content…). It is a modified version of a theme called omniblock.

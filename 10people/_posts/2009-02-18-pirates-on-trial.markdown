<div>So, as most of you will already know by now, day 3 of The Pirate Bay trial is now over. And, although it is probably the biggest blogged thing on the internet this week, but still I thought I would put down my thoughts.So, first of all, I read what happened today from http://torrentfreak.com/g-defense-090218/ and 1 part of it really made me think. Allow me to quote.

<div align="center">*“EU directive 2000/31/EG says that he who provides an information service is not responsible for the information that is being transferred. In order to be responsible, the service provider must initiate the transfer. But the admins of The Pirate Bay don’t initiate transfers. It’s the users that do and they are physically identifiable people. They call themselves names like King Kong,” Samuelsson told the court.*</div>I have one thing to say about this. If this EU directive really exists and says exactly that, then I’m sorry, but the prosecution have no case. If it is true that the information providers are not responsible unless they initiate the transfer, then they are not quilty of copyright infringment. Plain and simple. And anyone who says differently either manages to find a loophole (stupid lawyers) or is just stupid.

Secondly, I would like to agree totally with what [Mehall](http://mehalld.blogspot.com) [said](http://mehalld.blogspot.com/2009/02/bad-evidence.html) that TPB are no guiltier than Google. Infact, this is how I explained it to my non-technical friends, that they are basically google for the torrent world. And torrents in themselves are not illegal, nor are the majority of things in torrents. They just get a lot of bad press. P2P is a fantastic technology and should be used a lot more than it is.

So yeah, if TPB get out of this as the underdog, then it is a great amount of injustice, and we would need to have a wee look at the legal system and see what the heck is happening.

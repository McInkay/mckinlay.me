<div>Thought I would join in the new meme that seems to be going around Planet Ubuntu. Basically, you just post your speed test results from [SpeedTest.net](http://www.speedtest.net)![](http://www.speedtest.net/result/491943146.png)

Its funny how my upload speed is so rubbish when my download speed is fantastic. Its twice the national average (4.86), 3 meg above the global average and even 2 meg above my ISPs average. But less than half a meg up??? Seriously???

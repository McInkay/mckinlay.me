Just thought I would let you know that there have been a few changes to my blog over the past week. First of all, you will notice at the bottom of every article there is now a star rating. This is meant for people to rate what they think about my writing/reviews etc. Not about whether you agree with me, necessarily, but about whether you think it is a good article. I know that a lot of people don’t tend to comment on my blog, but if you are reading it you might be more willing to click a star. Please take the 2 seconds to do this as I like to know if I can improve at all.

The other thing is beside every comment there is a thumb up/thumb down button. This is to encourage conversation on my blog, as conversation is an important thing on any site. If people like your comments, they will vote them up. And the best votes float to the top of the pile (or at least they should do…). So, please continue to read my blog, but I’d love you to take part in commenting and talking about the subjects. I am thinking currently of making it easier for people reading the RSS feeds from my website to comment, or to rate articles and comments. Currently it isn’t possible for this, and that is something I would love to change, as you shouldn’t have to come to my site to do these things. You do have to currently, however.

There are a few architectural things within my site that have changed that should make it a bit faster and easier to find. You may not notice this at first, but it will get better.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy these changes, and I think I’ve set a new record for the amount of time I’ve had the same theme ![:-P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif) I like this one…

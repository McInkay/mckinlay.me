I’ve recently started playing with greasemonkey scripts. Greasemonkey is a [browser extension](http://www.greasespot.net/) that allows you to input javascript code into a webpage locally. This basically means you can change a website to how you would like it to do (well, as much as you can do with javascript).

So, I decided that I would do some page editing. I first of all turned my sights onto Google Reader. What a load of rubbish buttons and links that I never use. Why is that there? Thats what I was thinking. So, I wrote a greasemonkey script to get rid of all the rubbish that I don’t use. It may work for you as well, or it may not. Feel free to take the code and change it to how it would work for you. You can find the script [here](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-content/files/google_reader_hide_stuff.user.js). And you can find the rest of my scripts [here](http://www.10people.co.uk/index.php/my-projects/).

I am going to focus on another of my scripts in another blog post, but it isn’t quite up to scratch yet. You can have a look if you want.

I would recommend you to try out greasemonkey. It is great and stops you moaning about those little things in websites. Because, lets be honest, not every website is perfect for you. And how many times have you gone “I wish that wasn’t there” or “I would love this to be over here”. I would recommend using [this introduction](http://commons.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Greasemonkey_Hacks/Getting_Started) to greasemonkey from o’reilly. It really helped me in getting started with it.

Go script!!!

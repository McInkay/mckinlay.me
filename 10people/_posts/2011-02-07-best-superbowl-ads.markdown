I’ve spent a wee bit finding my favourite adverts from last nights superbowl, in ascending order.

Darth Vadar Volkswagen advert. Very funny, love it.

{% include video.html id="cuhQdQov6IQ" %}

Doritos advert.

{% include video.html id="jlYH_A4fyCU" %}

Best buy, buyback advert. Very funny and clever. Like the idea of the actual thing as well…

{% include video.html id="_pxChVDym4o" %}

Sony Ericsson Xperia Play ad. Very creepy, but very clever as well.

{% include video.html id="M4lxuoGgbxs" %}

Finally, my favourite, the Motorola Xoom ad, a very clever take on Apple’s 1984 superbowl ad. Like the whole play on it there, however their tagline “A tablet to create a better world” is a little bit…odd…

Anyway, hope you enjoyed these as well, if you find any that you like, send them in the comments. They would be def appreciated.

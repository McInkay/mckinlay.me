Ereaders…a great new technology that is going to go very far, but it isn’t quite there yet. There are such ereaders like the kindle, the nook and the sony e-reader. However, they aren’t perfect, and need some more features.

So, if you know me, and there aren’t many people that read this blog that know me, you may know that I love the idea of ereaders, but there are some specific things they need to do before I would buy one. Hit the jump to read what these are…

- colour
- touchscreens (with swiping to turn pages)
- higher resolutions
- video viewing

Now, some of these may seem like wishful thinking, but I do believe it is only a matter of time before we get them. Today, however, I can cross off 2 of these things, with the announcement of the [Skiff Reader](http://gdgt.com/skiff/reader/?utm_source=newatgdgt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gdgt).

We don’t know very much about the skiff reader yet, such as what formats it can read, whether there is any 3g connectivity in it, how much the books will be, etc…however we do know that its resolution is 1600 x 1200 (which is very large for a 11.5″ screen), and it has a touch screen.

There are no official words on  what you can do to change, as in whether you can swipe to change pages, but I’m assuming you will be able to. As you can see from the picture, it looks quite nice, a decent size, and the resolution looks beautiful. Obviously, there are a few things that need to happen before I buy an ereader, but this looks beautiful. Add in some colour and allow playback of video. Then you can view open formatted ebook formats, view pdfs, add a 3G connection like the kindle and you have yourself something I’d pay £100 for.

<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Disclaimer: My title is not a quote from EA, nor have they said anything.</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;">I do not work for EA, and my opinions expressed here are my own,</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;">and there is no fact in whether EA have contracts with any hardware </span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;">or software manufacturers, or anyone else in that case.</span><div style="text-align:left;">Now that I’ve done the legal stuff…on with the rant.I bought my girlfriend a pre-order of the Sims 3 for Christmas, as she really likes Sims 3. It was meant to come out on Feb 26th. Which we thought was an OK time to wait. Then, however, they decided to delay the release till June. Now, obviously this is something that couldn’t be avoided, and this is not what the rant is about.

What the rant is about, is the system requirements for The Sims 3. I shall quote from [http://www.thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/feature6.jsp](http://www.thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/feature6.jsp):

<div class="blogimage"></div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-style:italic;">The Sims 3 requires at least the following: </span>**FOR WINDOWS XP**  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * 2.0 GHz P4 processor or equivalent</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * 1 GB RAM</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * A 128 MB Video Card with support for Pixel Shader 2.0 </span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * The latest version of DirectX 9.0c</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * At least 6.1 GB of hard drive space with at least 1 GB of additional space for custom content and saved games</span>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"> FOR WINDOWS VISTA</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * 2.4 GHz P4 processor or equivalent</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * 1.5 GB RAM</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * A 128 MB Video Card with support for Pixel Shader 2.0 </span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * Microsoft Windows Vista Service Pack 1</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * At least 6.1 GB of hard drive space with at least 1 GB  
of additional space for custom content and saved games</span>

<span style="font-style:italic;"> For computers using built-in graphics chipsets under Windows,  
the game requires at least:</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * Intel Integrated Chipset, GMA 3-Series or above</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * 2.6 GHz Pentium D CPU, or 1.8 GHz Core 2 Duo, or equivalent</span>  
<span style="font-style:italic;"> * 0.5 GB additional RAM</span>

<div style="text-align:left;">Now…I’m sorry. But a 2.4Ghz processor? 1.5 Gb of RAM? 6.1 GB OF DISK SPACE WITH AT LEAST ANOTHER 1 GB FOR SAVES?What do they expect people have? Not everyone has a supercomputer. My computer could run it…but my girlfriend’s laptop (which is the computer SHE has, so it needs to run on that) has nowhere near that spec. Whether the RAM is total RAM for Windows as well…I’m not sure. But even still, her laptop only has 1GB in it.

I just have a feeling that EA has a contract with hardware manufacturers to bulk it up so people have to buy new hardware to run the Sims 3.

I mean…come on. The Sims 3 needs more system resources than Crisis for goodness sake.

As many of you know, I use identi.ca as my primary microblogging site, and I have recently tried out foursquare. I really like foursquare, and have stared using it quite a lot. However, foursquare only supports Facebook and Twitter as update mechanisms. I decided that I wanted to update my identica with foursquare stuff, and so that is where FourDenty came.

Rubbish name, I know, but I have very little imagination ![:-P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

Currently, FourDenty supports updating an identica account with all checkins that include a “shout”. It doesn’t support badge or mayor updates, but I am working on them. IT also doesnt support other status.net instances.

You can download the source and use it yourself, if you want. It is released under the AGPLv3, so if you change it, please re-release it ![:-)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

Also, if you find any bugs, or would like other features added in, please let me know, and I will add it to the list. I don’t expect anyone to want this, but I thought I would release it just incase anyone else has been having this problem.

You can get the source, install info, and dependancies [here](http://10people.co.uk/index.php/fourdenty). Let me know what you think if you try it.

Future work:

- Allowing badge and mayor updates
- Other status.net instances
- Simpler install process

Ok, so the first in my “Geeky ways to…do things”. I have had a great idea of saving electricity for heating.

Let me ask you a question…how are you reading this? The geeks of you may be using a smartphone, a netbook, or maybe even a commodore 64 (if you are…please tell me, I’d be very interested). But many of you will answer “My desktop.” Ok, another question. What is one of your biggest problems with your desktop? The answer may be “I can’t fit anymore RAM in”, “I wish I had 2 PCI-E 16x slots” or possibly “I want a 3rd quad-core slot in my motherboard”. (Again, if you really have this problem, please tell me, I’d be impressed). But what I think most of you would say is “The cooling.”

Right, so we have decided 2 things…we have a desktop computer. And, we have problems cooling it. Now we shall decide something else…we pay too much for electricity on heating. I hope you can see where I’m going. 1 thing we need to cool down, another we need to heat.

So…get rid of your case on your desktop, direct the heat around your house, and hey presto…you have a heating system. For the even geekier of you, get rid of your server room. Stick them around the place, and they will heat it up just nicely. It may not be the most efficient way to heat your house…but you are using the electricity anyways.

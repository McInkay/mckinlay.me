[![](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/palm-pre-hw-imp-10.jpg "palm-pre-hw-imp-10")](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/palm-pre-hw-imp-10.jpg)There has been a lot of discussion recently about Palm, WebOS, the palm pre and android. There are a few ideas about whether Palm could go bust in the near future, and I thought I would pop in my opinions.

The one thing we can all agree on, I think, is that Palm were a hugely innovating company. They made the pda. Name a pda…any pda at all. Was it a palm? Well, if it wasn’t you are just being difficult. I had a Palm T|X, and I am only 19. Seriously, they are the pda company. It was even changed to name after them. Palmtops. Most people call them that rather than PDAs. Whether or not you liked palms, you have to admit they made it in that era.

Ok, so now that we have agreed on that, this is where we get to the interesting things. Most people say that Palm should get rid of WebOS and adopt android. There was [a rumour](http://slashdot.org/submission/1198960/Rumor-Palm-ditching-webOS-for-Android?art_pos=19) about Palm doing this, but they have [since refuted it](http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/23/palm-moving-to-android-to-stay-alive-not-according-to-palm/). So, either that isn’t happening, or they haven’t decided whether they want to do this or not. But that doesn’t mean that this is a bad idea.

In my opinion, I think this is a bad idea. Palm should not, and I think they won’t switch to android. It is not good at all. It means that essentially we are back to iphone, winmo and android (yeah, I didn’t include maemo or symbian because symbian will be dead soon and maemo is nowhere near ready for normal user use. So, if Palm drop WebOS, we will be back a step on the way to diversity in the mobile market. The more Mobile OS we have, the better.

What I think Palm should do, is completely open WebOS, and do an android on it. Allow other companies to use it, put it on their phones, and develop everything around it. I think this would be good for Palm, good for the market, and ironically good for android. It would put huge publicity towards palm, allow so many more people to use it, so more developers will make apps, which means that people will start buying Palm Pres.

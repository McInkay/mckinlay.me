I’m sorry, I’ve ranted about this subject before, but what is the various phone companies’ obsessions with releasing a phone on 1 carrier? Lets have a look at various ones:

- HTC Dream (G1) – T-mobile
- HTC Magic – Vodafone
- Apple iPhone – O2
- Blackberry Storm – Vodafone

And now…the [Palm Pre will be on O2](http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/24/hello-o2-pres-gsm-flavor-finally-gets-a-launch-carrier-in-the/)

Seriously dudes? Why do you do that? It drives me insane. Obviously, I am not looking for a new phone just now, as I have my Nokia 5800, but it just drives me insane, a person who thinks we should have choice, that we don’t have choice to choose a phone, AND a carrier. You choose a phone OR a carrier nowadays.

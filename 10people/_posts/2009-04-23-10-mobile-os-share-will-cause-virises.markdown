Well…according to Albert-Laszlo Barabasi from Northeastern University in the US. If one mobile phone OS gains a 10% market share, then mobile phone viruses will become a lot more common.

From [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8014111.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8014111.stm) you can get 2 very important bits of information on how to deal with phones. First of all, if a mobile phone OS does get 10% market share, don’t use it. And second of all…for goodness sake don’t keep your bluetooth on all the time.

According to Albert-Laszlo’s research, the 600 viruses that exist just now could spiral out of control through bluetooth and multimedia messages (MMS) within a few hours.

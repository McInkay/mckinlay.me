![windows-7-logo](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/windows-7-free-for-1-year.jpg "windows-7-logo")Ok, so the world is abuzz with the official release of Windows 7. But, the question is, is it actually Windows 7? And if so, how did they get the numbering? Well, I have done a lot of thinking about this, and I decided that it really shouldn’t be. However, I found a [blog post](http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2008/10/14/why-7.aspx) confirming why they called it Windows 7.

> That brings us to Windows Vista, which is 6.0.  So we see Windows 7 as our next logical significant release and 7<sup>th</sup> in the family of Windows releases.

So, according to Microsoft, they have only had 7 major versions of Windows. Counting all they said, it should be 12 of them? But no, its 7. Glad that makes sence. XP doesn’t count as a major version? I can understand Windows 98SE not being counted, and maybe NT, but in my opinion the rest should be. So, is it Windows 10? Ach well, glad it all makes sence.

However, that is confusing enough. But it does not end there. Windows 7 ACTUALLY isn’t Windows 7. It just gets worse and worse. It is actually Windows 6.1. So, Windows 7 IS a major version of Windows, but it also ISN’T.

Now, I know you all probably know most of this, but I am posting this to celebrate the release of Windows 7/10/6.1. Just thought you could all think of the lovely times you have had with Windows, and post your fun times in the comments.

My funnest time ever was using Windows ME. Nothing worked on it, and it drove me insane for over a year. Windows ME was what pushed me over to Linux. So, thank you Microsoft for showing me the light ![:P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

Ok, I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 9.04 and, yet again, my audio set up really just doesn’t work. The first program that uses my sound, steals it. I’ve not figured out a way around this yet, but I will sometime.

I know, however, that this is not pulseaudio’s fault. It is Ubuntu. If I can direct you to [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/09/fedora_11_review/](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/09/fedora_11_review/) where they talk about Fedora and it’s pulseaudio implementation, which has just got better. They even have a cool application to turn specific application’s volumes up and down.

I have found very few people that have been complaining about sound in Fedora 10 or 11. But yet, we still can’t get pulseaudio even working in Ubuntu, never mind getting fancy features into it, like Fedora.

What is it that causes all these problems with pulseaudio in Ubuntu? I would love to know.

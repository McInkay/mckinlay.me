[![](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Selection_004.png "Selection_004")](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Selection_004.png)Many of you will have heard that Time Magazine have just released their “person of the year” for 2010. This is for the most newsworthy person this year. Not necessarily good, or anything like that. Influential and news worthy.

So, before they choose, Time like to ask people what they think. On the right, you can see the final public votes for this. It is absolutely clear from this who should be the winner, and remember this is all about the most newsworthy and influential person. Hitler won one year, infact, so it is not about how good the person is.

From the vote, it is clear than Julian Assange won. He has 382,025 votes, with an average of 92% rating. Compare that with the second place, Recep Tayyip Erdogan with total 233,639 votes and an average of 80%. That is over 100,000 votes more, and 12% higher average for Julian Assange than anyone else. That is absolutely massive. To me, it is clear who the person of the year is.

However…you may have heard who Time Magazine announced as person of the year…Mark Zuckerberg. Wait, is he on the list…oh, yeah, he is. Number 19. He got 18,353 votes with an average rating of 52…

What else can I say about that? 382,025 v 18353 and 92% v 52%

There are a few questions about this that I want to ask…

- What are Time’s editors smoking???

Seriously? Are they just trying to be annoying, or are high, or do they honestly think this makes sense?

- What has Zuckerberg done to deserve this, this year?

Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying that Mark Zuckerberg has not done anything, neither am I saying he is not worthy of getting an award like this. I am just saying, what has he done this year to be the most influential or newsworthy person? Was it the film? Well, I know almost noone who has even heard of the film, never mind seeing it. Was it the pledge to donate half of his money before his death to charity, that was very conveniently announced the week before this? I am not saying that thats not a great thing for him to do, seriously good on him, but it doesn’t really make him influential or newsworthy. Was it perhaps all the security and privacy concerns on facebook? Maybe… How about all the cool features that they have added this year? Or, maybe it is the fact that sooo many people have only just realised it exists? Hmmm…

- What is the point in the public vote?

Clearly, Time Magazine’s editors are just ignoring what people said. None of the top 9 people were chosen. Several of those people have been hugely influential and news worthy. Even if you do not believe that Julian Assange was influential and newsworthy, which I do, then how about The Chilean Miners? Recep Tayyip Erdogan? Barack Obama? Or even Lady Gaga? Seriously…all of them were pushed aside for number 10, Mark Zuckerberg. It makes you wonder why on earth they even have the public vote, as it seems to be just swept aside…

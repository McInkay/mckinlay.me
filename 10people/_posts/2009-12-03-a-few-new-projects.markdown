Just a quick wee post. Been busy reorganising my room and stuff. Well, I thought I would let everyone know about a few projects I am in, or thinking about starting.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Websites**</span>

I have a few websites I am working on. I can’t tell you what, as they aren’t finished yet, but one is a website for an up and coming photographer. This is the best website I have made so far, and I will let you know when its published ![:)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Evernote for WordPress**</span>

Ok, I wanted to integrate evernote into my wordpress dashboard, but realised there was no plugin. So, I’m going to develop one. There are 2 things I need to learn for this to happen:

1. How to make a wordpress plugin
2. Evernote api

I have been looking at the evernote api, and this doesn’t seem like it should be too hard to make, but we will see.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**BrownHat – Linux for Outlaws**</span>

Many of you may be involved in the Linux Outlaws community. Well, there are a group of us developing a Linux Distro for people in the community. I am one of the head devs on it. We have a few places you can go to find out about it:

1. Code homepage – [http://code.google.com/p/brownhat/](http://code.google.com/p/brownhat/)
2. IRC room – #brownhat on irc.freenode.net
3. [Forum topic](http://linuxoutlaws.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2205) for brownhat kind of like our mailing list just now.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**VPS**</span>

I have a new VPS that I am sharing with [Root Admin](http://www.rootadmin.co.uk) and I am looking at moving my website to it. So, if my blog is down at all, this is why ![:P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

So there we have it. There are a number of things I am working on, so have fun reading about my joys through these as I blog about them ![:)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

A couple of things that I needed to say, first of all, Firefox 3.5 has officially been released! Woop! That is good. It is 2 times faster than firefox 3, 10 times faster than firefox 2 and it implements the new HTML 5 ![:)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

So I would advise you all to get it asap.

Second of all, an update on my sound issues with Karmic Koala…it has now completely died. It doesn’t recognise my sound card anymore. Really annoying…I’ll have to file a bug for this.

Sorry about all the posts I have posted today, but I needed to say these ![:P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

Ok, some of you may remember I put down my [10 predictions for the coming year](http://yamanickill.wordpress.com/2009/01/07/tech-predictions/). Well, a few of them have come true. Lets see…

**2. Apple won’t wait till Christmas to release their new Iphone, which is what they said they will do.** – Turns out I was right with this one. They have released the iPhone 3Gs already, halfway through the year  
**5. I will get my computer working again.** – This one did happen, but I didn’t update you with it. I got my money back for my old motherboard, and bought a new one.  
**6.Google will release 2 more versions of their G range of phones, taking as long to release the source code as they did with the first version.** – Turns out this one is right as well, with the release today of the [HTC Hero](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/06/htc-hero/)  
**7. Canonical will make an increasingly stupid name for version 9.10 of Ubuntu. Kranky Kangaroo or something.** – This one happened as well. As we all know, it is called Karmic Koala  
**10. Thunderbird 3.0 might get released…that would be nice…taking long enough.** – This one might happen soon, as we currently have the Beta 2 of Thunderbird, and mozilla don’t do many betas (ha…)

So, looks like a very successful year for me so far in predictions. More to come people…

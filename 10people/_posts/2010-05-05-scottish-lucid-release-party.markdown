Use Ubuntu? Or any other Linux/open source operating system? Or just want to find out what it is all about? Bored of the election? Want to vote and then run away from it all?

Come and celebrate the release of Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) at Strathclyde University’s Union Lounge.

We will be having social time, demonstrations of the 4 official Ubuntu derivatives (including the brand new lubuntu), cds for you to take away, and there is a bar onsite so you can buy some beer or whatever you want to drink.

There is a map in this post, so if you don’t know where the Strathclyde Union is, have a look (if you are reading this is a feed reader, you may have to view the [full post](http://www.10people.co.uk/2010/05/05/707/). Anyway, enough talk, here are the details, we hope to see you there.

**Where?** – The Lounge, level 5, Strathclyde University’s Union

90 John Street, Glasgow, G1 1JH

**When?** – Thursday 6th May from 18:00 to 22:00 (come for all or any of it, pop in at any time).

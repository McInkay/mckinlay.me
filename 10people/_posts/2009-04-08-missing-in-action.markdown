I haven’t really been blogging much recently at all. Life has just been so busy. What with uni, church, and now holidays. I won’t be on the internet at all for the next week, as I am away on holiday to Spring Harvest.

Spring Harvest is a Christian event where thousands of Christians come to worship together and also generally have fun in a great big week of funness. Obviously you non-christians out there might not understand how a Christian event could be fun, well, for you it may not. It all depends on your attitude towards it. But to me, it is fun.

So, don’t expect any blogging. I may tweet with my phone, but that’ll be it. I won’t be able to see your tweets either.

I will try and be a bit more regular with my blogging after the holiday, but until exams are over, I can’t guaruntee anything.

I do have a few things I’m going to try after exams.

1. Install Arch Linux and see if it is any good.
2. Install #! 9.04.01 64-bit beta to see if it is stable enough for use just now.
3. Learn python.
4. See if I can make some patches for terminator.

So, I hope everyone has a good Easter holiday, and doesn’t get too fat on chocolate.

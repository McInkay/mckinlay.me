This is just a quick post to officially launch my new blog, [http://www.alistotle.co.uk](http://www.alistotle.co.uk) – it will focus on more theological, philosophical and ethical issues, which occasionally will involve technology. If you only want to know about the computery posts, then don’t follow the new blog as I will cross post those to my current blog, [http://www.10people.co.uk](http://www.10people.co.uk).

So, say hello to my new blog, and that’s all ![:-)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

 

**UPDATE** – Turns out my cross posting doesn’t currently work, but the blog is still published…will update when this is fixed. Not just now though, I’m going to bed….

**UPDATE 2** – I managed to fix the issue only 4 months after initially posting this. Now this should be posted on 10people.co.uk as well ![:-)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

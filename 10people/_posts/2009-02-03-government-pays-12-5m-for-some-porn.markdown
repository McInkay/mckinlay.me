<div>Yep, thats right. £50M for a piece of porn. Wanna see?![](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45436000/jpg/_45436581_titianpa466.jpg)[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7863635.st](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7863635.stm)

Now, I’m off to bed, I’m not in the mood to rant too much about it, I’ll do that tomorrow. Just thought I’d make sure I remember about it.

——-The next morning——–

Ok, so you probably won’t care about the fact that I am writing the rest of this the morning after, but I thought it would explain the change in writing style.

So, what I would like to know is, where did the credit crunch go? I thought we were in recession. No? We have that amount of money to spend on a bit of canvas with some naked ladies on it? Ok…fair enough.

What makes this painting worth that stupid amount of money anyway? What makes ANYTHING worth £50M?

And…more…they are looking to raise another £50M of our money to spend on a picture that is pretty much the same, just with a few less naked ladies.

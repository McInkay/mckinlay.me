Just to let you know I’ll be doing some work on my VPS today. We have had 2 instances in the past 2 weeks where apache or mysql have killed my server, so I’m going to spend today replacing both of them. Woop! Thats just to let you know what happens ![:-)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

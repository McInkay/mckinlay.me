What do these have in common:

- RAM Memory
- RAID Disks
- PIN Number
- DNS Server

The answer is…they are all wrong

- Random Access Memory Memory
- Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks Disks
- Personal Identification Number Number
- Domain Name Server Server

These really annoy me these things. There are plenty more, but I came across another one today… PAT Testing!!! PAT – portable appliance testing. So why call it Portable Appliance Testing Testing?

£45000. That’s how much it cost a glaswegian art gallery to pay for this bit of canvas. (Obviously the woman isn’t part of the painting, she is the painter.)

Does it not seem a bit ridiculous that in a world where people are starving, [not everyone has a home](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless#Tracking_and_counting_the_homeless), and there are billions (yes…billions. [about 6 billion](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm)) of people who do not have access to the internet, that we can spend that amount of money on something that, lets be honest, doesn’t actually look all that good.

Ok, it is a moving bit of fabric. Very good…she can paint without actually having to see it. Lovely. But first of all, what makes it the “phantom painting”? When I saw the [news title on the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7752232.stm), I thought it meant a picture that was like eery, or had been found behind another or something like that. I didn’t think it would be a picture of a bit of silk.

O and one last thing. What is the definition of a charity?

[dictionary.reference.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/charity) says this:

“The Art Fund is an independant charity that exists to save art for everyone to enjoy”

I get it…they are giving money to rich people. Got it. These art sellers need that money. Homeless people don’t.

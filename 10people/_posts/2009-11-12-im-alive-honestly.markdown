Ok, so, you may have noticed that I’ve not been blogging for weeks. Well, its not because I’ve had nothing to blog about. I have. I’ve got a list as long as my arm, but I’ve just not had the time to do it. For a number of reasons. Firstly, I have changed course.

I decided that Chemical Engineering wasn’t for me, and I am now doing a BSc in Computer Science. So, I’ve been having to catch up on 6 weeks worth of work, which has taken up almost all my time.

So, this is basically a blog post to let you know that I’m still alive, I haven’t forgotten about the blog, and there are a number of blogs in the making. The next few should be “Ubuntu Karmic: My upgrade experiences.” and “Google Wave: Why it may or may not be the future.”

Hopefully I should get at least one of those up by the end of the week, and the other one next week.

O yeah, blogging wednesday is now blogging Thursday because of my change of course ![:P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

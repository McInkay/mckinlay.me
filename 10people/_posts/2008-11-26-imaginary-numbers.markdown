<div>Ok, I’m sure that a lot of people love imaginary numbers, but for the life of me, I can’t understand them at all.I probably shouldn’t be blogging about this just now, or thinking about imaginary numbers for the fact because I have a maths test tomorrow which is not about imaginary numbers…but they just really get me so badly.

I’m struggling with the logic of something not being positive, or negative, or 0. And on that subject, if it isn’t positive or negative, then how can you get -i? That makes no sense.

I am fine with most things in maths. Whole numbers…yep ok, happy. Negative…again, happy. Real numbers…yep, happy yet again. Irrational numbers…yep happy with them. At least pi means 3.14159… etc, and e means 2.7…etc. But i does not mean anything.

Someone can say it means something as much as they like…but it doesn’t. How can you get the square root of a negative number? You can’t. If you sqaure ANYTHING (o except i) you get a positive number. So how can i be anything.

Maybe I am being stubborn. But I’m not.

Anyways…I’m off to make sure I’m happy with differentiation in its many different forms. Woop.[](http://technorati.com/tag/i)

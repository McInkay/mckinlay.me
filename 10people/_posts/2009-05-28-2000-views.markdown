I just noticed that my blog just hit 2000 views. I don’t like posting blogs like this, they feel like they should be tweets, but 2000 views is a lot. I’m quite amazed that either a lot of people look at my blog once, or a few people look at it lots of times…either way, I’m happy. Thanks for reading my random, and occaisionally useful, information.

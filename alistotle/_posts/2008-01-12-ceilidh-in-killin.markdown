But that happened to me anly a few hours ago. Here is proof. This is me and Jamie with none other than Martin Smith, the lead singer of Delirious?. There are another 3 pictures on my flickr so feel free to check them out.

So yeah, all in all, tonight was a good night. Ceildh dancing, food, free drinks, worship songs during dancing (doing the Virginia Reel to Tim Hughes “Happy Day” is well fun.) and meeting some cool Christian Singers.

Nothing much happened that wasn’t totally and utterly cool tonight. And to think…I wasn’t sure whether I was going to go tonight or not. But I did, and it was amazing.

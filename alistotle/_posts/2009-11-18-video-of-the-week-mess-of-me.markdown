Ok, so, I said last week I’ll be blogging. That didn’t happen. But I will tomorrow, as it is Blogging Thursday tomorrow. (I need to think of a better name, as it isn’t alliterative. Ach well. Anyways the video…

Some of you may have heard of the band “Switchfoot”. They are an American Christian rock band. But they have a huge following in the non-christian charts in America. They have just released their new album “Hello Hurricane”. And there are loads of amazing songs on it. So, to celebrate this great new album, I am choosing their song “Mess of Me” for this weeks Video of the Week. Expect lots of these in the coming months if I run out of decent videos ![:P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

Anyway, enjoy. Even if you aren’t a Christian, you may still really like this. Its a great song by a great great band.

Today, however, the improbable happened. I won. I was pink, and my mission was to conquer Australia, Europe, and one other continent. I had 1 in Australia, but as my sister had the other 3, I was very quickly booted out of there. So I set about settling a base in Africa. I conquered most of Africa, when I had 3 cards to give me 8 more armies, allowing my Army which was floating around Australia to bombard and conquer Australia. Very soon afterwards, the rest of Africa fell, and I set about strengthening for the last bombardment into Europe.

After a few turns of conquering random Asian countries, I got what I needed, 1 card of each, allowing me to get 10 extra armies. I placed these Armies in North Africa, however, unlike what my oponents thought, I wasn’t about to create an assault on South America to stop my Mother’s Western Reign. I did, however, attack Europe from below, and half-way through, my mother realised, but with only 4 countries left to defeat, 3 of which had 2 armies, and 1 having 1 army in, there wasn’t much she or my sister could do to stop my 18 strong army bombarding its way through Europe. It looked at one point, that I might not manage it, when I only had 4 armies left, with 1 country left to defeat, but luck seemed to be on my side, and I squashed Scandanavia, bringing home the victory that I shall cherish forever.

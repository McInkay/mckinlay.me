Well…today I am recovering from a lovely illness. Twas lovely. Sick all the time. Euch. Ach well…I am feeling much better and should be fully better by this evening. One thing, however, which does annoy me about being sick, is that everyone…and I mean EVERYONE has a different way to get you better. Everyone tells ya to “do this” or “eat this” or “drink this”. In my opinion, two of the silliest I’ve heard are

1. Eat on orange…I can see where this is coming from, as it has vitamin C, but to me, eating an orange is just silly because it is acidic and turns your empty, unsettled stomach.

2. Drink flat coke…I can also see where this one is coming from…because it gives you a lot of sugar which helps to keep your energy up, and because it is flat, it doesn’t upset you too much…but it still seems a silly thing to drink when you are ill.

As for me…what do I do when I am ill? I just wait it out until I amn’t sick..then I eat. Simple…lol. People tell me I should drink something…which I would do if the drink had enough time to actually give me anything…but it doesn’t…it comes straight up again. Tis silly. Ach well.

It is Spring Harvest on Saturday ![:)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) This is a good thing as I get another holiday, and I get to go back to Spring Harvest. Tis a fantastic thing and I always enjoy it. For anyone who doesn’t know, it is a big Christian conference, which is held over, and near, easter, in 2 locations (Butlins at Skegness and Minehead) for 3 weeks. There are things for all ages…and gigs in the evenings. If you wish to find out more, go to [http://www.springharvest.org/](http://www.springharvest.org/) for all the info you could want.

I just lost the game.

And speaking of this, I found out about this fantastic website. [www.lost.eu/7529d](www.lost.eu/7529d) It is a website that connects over 400000 people worldwide, through one note left in a cafe in England with a website URL on it. Basically, you get your own link (mine is [www.lost.eu/7529d](www.lost.eu/7529d) and you are to give it to as many people as possible, in the most imaginative ways. My problem is, I haven’t had time to imagine imaginitive ways yet so I decided to put it on here. Because if you go 30 days without someone joining through your link, you lose.

Hense why I just lost the game.

Man, this is getting too confusing with all these different games.

So…that is enough for just now. Ciao.

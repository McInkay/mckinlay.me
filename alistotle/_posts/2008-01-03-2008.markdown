Yep, its that time again. Its new year…time to make “resolutions” (although why noone ever makes them at any other time of the year I dont know). I mean…what is the point in going “This year I won’t eat chocolate” or “I will work out 3 times a day for 2 hours at a time” or “I’ll stop smoking” when you KNOW you won’t last till the 3rd?

Then again there is everything that happens on New Years day…which is…a grand total of nothing. It is a WASTE of a day. Why not just keep things open, but make them open slightly later to allow people to still have a lie in? It just annoys me that apart from visiting relatives and watch TV there is nothing to do.

Then there is writing dates in January through to November. You suddenly are hit with a new year, and have to write “2008” instead of “2007”, but just as you get used to writing it, it goes and changes again.

Enough rants for tonight…as I move into tomorrow, have a good day.

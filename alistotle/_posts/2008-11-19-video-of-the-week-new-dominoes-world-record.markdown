<div>I have just been so busy with things I haven’t had time to do much of my blogging. I did, however, find this fantastic video, and thought I would post it as my video of the week. I’m planning on blogging once more tonight…but we’ll see whether it happens or not.So, video…this is a video of parts of the new world record for the most number of dominoes knocked over in one go. Over 4 million of them. On National Domino Day.

Enjoy…

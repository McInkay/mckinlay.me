Well…technically not a new room, but it is mine now. Not shared. Simon just moved into staff houses so I’m on my own now ![:D](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)

It feels great just having so much space, but I don’t know how long it will last. I’m living every moment not knowing if I’m staying in this room on my own or not. Tis weird. I’d quite like to, but dunno.

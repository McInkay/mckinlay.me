This has to be the coolest thing I’ve seen in ages. I know I said I’d put the other video on, and I will later in the week, this is a special Video of the Week, as it is soooo immense.

Take 24 SSDs, hook them up to a computer that has 2 quad-core computers, 4 GB of ram, 2 graphics cards and 2 whopping great fans, and what do you get? The most powerful consumer computer to date…I want this machine…

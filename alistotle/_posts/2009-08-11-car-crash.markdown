This is partly one of those “I’m sorry I don’t blog enough” posts that seem to make up about 1/4 of my blog posts. But it is for a very different reason than just “I wa[![Rainbow](http://blog.10people.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/3799635835_07d8b3e9f7_b-300x199.jpg "Rainbow")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gordon_mckinlay/3799635835/in/set-72157621857604749/)s busy”. Well, first of all, I have been away for a week from 31st July, till 7th August leading at a [Scripture Union](http://www.suscotland.org.uk) camp at [Scoughall, near North Berwick](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&ie=UTF8&cd=1&geocode=FRU6VwMdGdLX_w&split=0&layer=x&&ll=56.041363,-2.619896&spn=0.032506,0.071497&z=14). This was a camp with 50 young kids, and 25-ish leaders. The days were filled with activities, such as archery, the assault course and mountain biking. Scripture Union is a Christian organisation who among many other things, run lots of these camps throughout the summer. I went to many of these camps as a child, and now that I am older, I am giving something back to them by leading at them, to help kids learn about what I believe.

Ok, so, that is my excuse until last Friday, but I can hear people saying “What about since then?” Well, my girlfriend was around at my house for the weekend, so I was busy then until Sunday. But that still doesn’t explain the last 2 days. And also, I’m sure I can hear some people looking back up to the title of the post and going “Eh? What has this got to do with anything?” Well, when I drove my girlfriend back to her house on Sunday afternoon, coming back, I crashed my car. Clever of me.

I was driving up a road at 45 mph (speed limit was 60, btw) turning a nice smooth corner, when suddenly, the car just kept turning the corner. The car spun 180 degrees around on the road, across the opposite carriageway, off the road sideways, lifting 2 wheels off the ground, hit a tree (which put a huge dent in the roof), spun round another 90 degrees, and came down on top of another tree. So, needless to say, the police said that the car was probably written off. We haven’t had a call from the garage yet, but that is what we are assuming.

According to the police, they think there was some diesel or something on the road, which meant the car just kept turning, and I had no control over it. Thinking about what they said and what happened makes sense. That is what it felt like.

So, 6 months driving, one car written off. Woop!

I will have a few pics of the car that I will upload onto here once I get them off my sister. Until then, just enjoy the one of camp up at the top. This was taken by [Gordon](http://http://www.flickr.com/photos/gordon_mckinlay/) [McKinlay](http://http://gordonsramblings.blogspot.com/).

Once again, I’ve left it a while since my last blog. A lot has happened obviously, but I can’t think of it all.

I’m really settled here…as I cannot see my floor. I will tidy it up later (aye right…). I recently went home and realised that there are loads of things that I miss, however it is still great here. Typical I can’t get the best of both worlds eh lol

Chickens are doing good, they are laying around 8-10 eggs a day, out of 12 chickens.

I’ve been working hard on maintenance, and I actually have my first kitchen shift on friday. It’ll be weird. I also just thought that I have been here for nearly 3 months. That is scary. And I’ve not mortally injured myself either. Yes, I hurt myself almost every other day, but nothing serious.

Staff conference is on tuesday, should be interesting. Spending 4 days with 100 people who all work with the same company as me, but loads of them I have never met. Then again there is the weird few that I have met. If everyone is like them, then there’s no hope for staff conference.

Right, recently I’ve not been getting much sleep, so I’m going to bed right now.

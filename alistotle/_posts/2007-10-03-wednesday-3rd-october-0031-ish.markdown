<div>What does a person, whom has a day off, do at half past midnight as he is deciding he should probably go to bed, but he really doesn’t want to, but there is noone to talk to on msn anyways?He writes a blog that he has been meaning to write for aaaaages. Anyway, here we go.

Many a thing has happened since I last blogged (o so long ago).

We got hens. And they are great :D. I have been picked as the person who does most things with the hens, such as putting them to bed, getting them up when Will is off, and taking their eggs out. However, I amn’t in total charge of them. They have actually started laying as well. 6 eggs so far, and we have only had them for 2 weeks today (they are meant to start laying between 2 and 6 weeks) so that is pretty good :D.

What else happened…I caught a mole today, my 4th that I found, but I still only have 1 that got caught in one of my traps…so that mole was technically Wills grrrrr.

I can’t actually think of anything else exciting that has happened recently, which is quite boring, so I shall leave it until later today, once I’ve had some sleep, when I can think of something.

Firstly, apologies for the lack of blog posts recently, I have been extremely busy with both uni work, and a new website I am creating for someone. I’ll let ya know about it when I’m done, I’m sure my client would love the publicity ![;-)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

Anyways, this weeks’ video is about the new Humble Bundle. You will all have heard of it if you read my blog. The Humble Bundles are games that you can name your price for a cross-platform, drm-free awesome game and help charity at the same time. This is the video promo for the new one, and I quite liked the video so thought I would share that as well as telling you all to go buy this game. I would if I had any money just now, but it looks pretty awesome.

Best quote from the video : “Whatever the verb for Google+ is”

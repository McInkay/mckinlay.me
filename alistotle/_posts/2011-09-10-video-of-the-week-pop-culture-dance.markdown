I recently found this out thanks to [Alan Pope](http://www.gplus.to/popey) on google plus. He simply said “I *love* this video. All of it. Every time I watch it.” – so I had to watch it. And ya know what, I do too. The video is so awesome, so intricate, the dancing is great but the actual video editing and the time and effort put into this is the most awesome bit about it. The song as well, is just fascinating. [Madeon](http://www.youtube.com/itsmadeon "Madeon on Youtube") managed to mix this completely live, with clips from 39 different songs. See how many you can tell, and then go onto his youtube page and see if you were right, and what ones you missed. (I got 4…)

Anyways, enough prefab…lets get on with the awesome video.

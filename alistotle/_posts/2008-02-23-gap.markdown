Ok…I haven’t posted on here for ages, because my laptop was broken. However, I fixed it (after like a month) and am now catching up on everything.

Not a huge amount has actually happened in the past month. The chickens have started laying properly again, which is good.

We got badges. Name badges. They are really annoying just now because basically we have to wear them whenever we are where guests could be. It is so they know we are part of the team. Its understadable, but annoying. Mine has already been through the wash once, and so is broken. However, I did fix it with a safety pin and blue electrical tape. Woop.

I don’t think there is much that I can remember just now. The annoyances of not blogging for a month is you forget everything that has happened.

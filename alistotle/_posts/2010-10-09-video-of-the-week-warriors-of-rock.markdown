Before the video, a wee bit of housekeeping. Incase you are wondering where my 6-monthly Ubuntu review is (as 10.10 releases tomorrow), well don’t worry, it’ll be here. I’m working today but will hopefully finish it tonight and release it tomorrow (no guarantees though). It is looking great so far though.

Anyway, on with the video. As many of you will know, Guitar Hero 6: Warriors of Rock was released recently. I currently haven’t bought it (but I am saving up for it) but here is the trailer to celebrate. It is a pretty cool trailer. Makes me excited about it!!!

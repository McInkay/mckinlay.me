<div>So, I’m gonna do regular (well, maybe) blog’s for you to know what I’m doing here at the lovely Abernethy Trust (o wait…not Trust anymore…its just Abernethy Outdoor Centre, Ardeonaig) or something… but here’s my address for anyone wanting it.Alistair McKinlay

So, I got here a couple of hours ago, and immediately made sure my internet was working (which it is :D:D:D) and went on here to blog.

Another thing in my blogs will be the song. I will, almost always, be listening to a song, and the blogs will tell you at the bottom (courtesy of FoxyTunes)

so yeah, not much in this blog…until later dudes (and dudettes).

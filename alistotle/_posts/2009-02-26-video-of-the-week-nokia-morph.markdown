<div>For some reason recently, I’ve really been interested in concept videos. This one, I think, is one of the best ideas around. It makes people who want touchscreen keyboard because it can change AND people who want a physical keyboard cause clearly they are just so much better(I mean, who wants a keyboard that you can’t feel.), both happy. And it just brings so many cool ideas together. I want this phone. I especially want the phone type style that it can morph into. Seriously…it looks amazing.<div class="youtube-video"></div>P.s. Steven – you do nano-technology…get working on this ![:P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

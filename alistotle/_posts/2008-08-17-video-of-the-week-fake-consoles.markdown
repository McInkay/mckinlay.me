Ok, basically, this is a video of a bunch of pictures of “leaked” Ps3s, Xbox 360s and Wiis, before they were official announced. I find it amusing for a number of reasons

- Some of them are quite close
- Some of them are now being used as “leaked” Ps4s, Xbox 720s and Wii2s
- They look really interesting and one wonders how they got the ideas

So here you go…”leaked” Ps3s, Xbox 360s and Wiis

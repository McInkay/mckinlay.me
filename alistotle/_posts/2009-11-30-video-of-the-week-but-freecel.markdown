Ok, this weeks video of the week is not actually called “but…freecell”, but it is my favourite quote from the video. This is a fantastic video. Yeah, ok, I don’t agree with everything in the video, but its still hilarous.

Oh, btw, there is quite a bit of swearing at the end. So, technically NSFW. Its only one word, just repeated quite a few times.

**[edit]** I forgot to say…don’t let Windows make you feel sorry for it. It had its day ![:P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)**[edit]**

Enjoy!!!

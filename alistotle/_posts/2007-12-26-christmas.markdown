Christmas…the very word strikes fear in the heart of every man.

Thought processes tend to go like this.

“Ok, I need to get a present for ——.  
What can I get them?  
No idea.  
Maybe I’ll have a look around shops.  
Shops…I don’t want to go there………  
………………………………………………….  
………………………………………………….  
…eureka! Internet!

*4 hours later*  
So, I’ve ordered £50 worth of stuff…now for that present.”

The problems with the internet and shopping is that you see things you don’t need. Although, it is fantastic for buying presents. That is, when I don’t get other people to buy things.

But the other problem is the thoughts around Christmas time. Minds are full of “what can I buy them”. I just think it is far too commercialised a lot of the time. Ok, most of the time. Even when we have a wee nativity play, we still seem to think a lot about presents. Yes, its nice to give presents, and its about family, but also, its about “God and Me” not about “Me and my family”. A lot of the time in this world we think too much about ourselves, and (dare I saw it) our families.

I’m not saying families aren’t important…they are, but I’m also saying that sometimes we just need to focus on God. At the end of this Christmas period, can I urge you to spend some time just with God.

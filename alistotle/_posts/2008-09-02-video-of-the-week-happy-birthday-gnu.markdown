It just so happened, that I found a great video just at the time when It was time for my Video of the Week.

Basically, this video is Stephen Fry talking about Free Software, in celebration of the 25th anniversary of GNU. He explains the philosophy of Free Software better than I ever have, and I think Iâ€™ll have to quote him when telling people about linux.

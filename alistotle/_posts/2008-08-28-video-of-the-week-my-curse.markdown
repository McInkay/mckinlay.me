Ok, so it took me a while to decide on what to put for my video of the week, this week, but I decided on this one. I was playing guitar hero, again, and I was playing this song, and decided I really liked it. It was quite nice to play on guitar hero as well. I love the guitar work in the song. The video itself is a bit weird, and I wonder how they thought about some of these things.

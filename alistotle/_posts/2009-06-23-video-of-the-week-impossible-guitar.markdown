Song of the week, this weeek, is a really amazing video of a guy playing Mozart’s “The Marriage of Figaro” on the guitar. What is cool, is he is playing 3 different guitar parts, that he has recorded note by note, and put together, along with the video of him with interesting facial expressions.

It is quite a cool video, and reminds me a lot of a video I watched a long time ago that was a guy who did something similar, but with his voice, saying the name of the instrument. It’s really annoying cause I can’t remember what it is called, and I want to link to it. If anyone knows the video, comment with it, and I’ll put it up as next week’s Video of the Week.

So…here we go.

***EDIT***

It is ok, I found it, you don’t need to tell me, and I will post it next week as the Video of the Week.

Ok, to start off with I amn’t going to explain the title of this seemingly odd blog.

I am going to explain what I did yesterday.

I had a day off yesterday, so Dave asked me and a few other people if we wished to join him on a days walking. I agreed. So yesterday, at 9am, we left the centre, and headed in the new minibus to Fort William.

It took us around 2 hours to get there, and when we got there, we got out, and looked up at our walk…Ben Nevis. The highest mountain in Britain.

So we started the walk up, the weather was amazing, as you can see from the first picture. We walked 3 quarters up the hill in just a tshirt and trousers. Even walking for 400m up in the snow. However, it then started to get windy, so I had to put some more clothes on.

By now, you probably know where I am going with this story and with the title. Well, when we got to the top, we took some pictures, delighted in the fact that we were currently higher than all 60 million people in Britain, and raved. You can see the rave here – [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVIhkeC9L8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVIhkeC9L8)

So, now that we had the highest rave in Britain, we decided that we would sledge halfway down Ben Nevis. (We would have done it all, had it not been for the fact that we ran out of snow halfway down). 1 little problem with this, was the fact that we didn’t have any sledges. So, we just used our behinds. It was extremely fast, faster than I have every been on a sledge. And it was steep. And it just kept coming and coming. Was one of the best experiences of my life. That half of the mountain that took us 2 and a quarter hours to walk up, took us 15 minutes to slide down.

The whole journey took 3 and a half hours up the mountain, and 1 and a half down.

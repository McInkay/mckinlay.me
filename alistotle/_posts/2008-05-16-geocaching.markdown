Ok, so I’ve been recently struck with how fun, addicting, energetic and educational geocaching actually is.

I went geocaching this week for a day with my sister and her fiancee. We did 6 caches, so that brings my total to 13 I think. And to be honest, I enjoyed the day so much. We got to see many beautiful sights, got to get some exercise and got to join in on the huge, worldwide game. Playing with millions of other people is something that just makes me excited. Its the same sort of rush you get when you play MORPGs (Multi-player Online Roleplaying Games). Just the whole community aspect.

And then theres the educational side. Lots of geocaches have information with them. Ranging from the ridiculous Monty Python and the Holy Grail, at the cave of the were-rabbit. All the way through information about the area, about people, to things completely unrelated to the cache.

Take the picture for example. Turns out this axel was from a car belonging to an old lady. She had crashed her car on the A85, near a cache we were at. I don’t know any of the details or anything, but it makes you think. I just find it really interesting seeing stuff like this.

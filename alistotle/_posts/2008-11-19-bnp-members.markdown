<div>Ok, so I heard about the list of BNP (British National Party) members being leaked, and it is an interesting story.So, basically, a list of all BNP members has been leaked to a site on the internet, and supposodly it is illegal for Police to be members of the BNP, so they will be sacked, and some teachers might be sacked because of it.

Now, maybe it is just me, but I think this is absolutely pathetic. Why do we sack people because of what they believe? And why just the BNP? I am going to say right now, however, **I do not support the BNP in anyway**, I am just trying to ask why on earth we, a country that is supposodly a democracy, can sack people because of something they believe in.

Yes, if the policeman/woman was being unfair because of what they believe, then that is perfectly fine that they be sacked from the job, because they are being unfair. It is the same with anything else. If a policeman/woman or a teacher would be unfair to someone of a religion because of their religious belief, or something similar, then we would also sack them. But we wouldnâ€™t sack them because of what they believe. That is just pathetic.

I do disagree with what the BNP say, but I just think it is highly unfair that we sack people because of what they believe, especially if they do not let that affect the way they treat people.

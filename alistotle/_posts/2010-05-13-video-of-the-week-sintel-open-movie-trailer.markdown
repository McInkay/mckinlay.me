Some of you may know what [Blender](http://www.blender.org) is. It is an open source 3d modelling application which is starting to be used by professional film creators. The Blender foundation have created a film called [Big Buck Bunny](http://www.bigbuckbunny.org) and a game called [Yo Frankie!](http://www.yofrankie.org/). They are both completely open creations. You can download all of the character models, and the whole film in its origional film for free, and change it how you like it. Now, however, they are creating their new film, and here is the trailer for itâ€¦

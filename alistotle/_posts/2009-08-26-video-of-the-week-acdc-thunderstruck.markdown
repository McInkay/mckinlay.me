Ok, I’ve not blogged much, except with videos, but with good reason. It was my birthday on Monday. I shall blog about what I recieved soon, but in the meantime, its time for another Video of the Week. This one goes out to the GeekSoc guys (mainly drochaid) who gave me this as an idea, and I suddenly went “Man alive, why have I not done this before.” It is the magnificent AC/DC with their fantastic song Thunderstruck

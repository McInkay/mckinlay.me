<div>Day 9 at Abernethy, Ardeonaig. Alistair is sitting in his room, on his laptop. Not breaking it, despite his weight due to his unfitness.That nicely brings us to the topic of yesterday. However, being the weird person that I am, I won’t tell you about yesterday yet. Because that would make too much sense. Instead, I will start…at the beginning (the day after my last blog). That makes much less sense. Hmmm…so when was my last blog? the first day I was here? Yeah, I think so.

Well…Monday was my first day of work. Was on house doing changeover (the joys) Nothing much happened on Monday, although afterwards me, Hamish and Andrew did go and jump in the Gorge. Twas very wet…and cold. However, luckily, it was warm outside of the water

Tuesday…I moved into my new room :D:D:D. With Simon (german dude, but don’t hold that against him). Not much happened the next coupld of days tbh. Centre…centre…more centre…house…day off…centre half. The centre got invaded on friday. Simon (my roomate) had 2 guests coming…his brother and his brother’s girlfriend. The German’s came…and they haven’t left.

Ok, nothing else much happened until Sunday, the day you have all been wanting me to tell you about.

Well, origionally I was going to have a day off on Sunday, however, Phil had given me 2 days off a week, instead of 1 and a half. So, it got changed from a day off to a Centre half. However, I was the only person on Centre. So, Will (or Nat, centre man) phoned me and told me to go to church in the morning, and help with house just before and after, and that would be it. So that was fine.

However, there was no bus going to church. So I was like…hmmm. Hamish was going to cycle, so Lara (office person) said, you could cycle too. And I was like “yeah, how hard can that be”. Biiiiig mistake. halfway through I was standing at the side of the road nearly throwing up. I never realised how unfit i was. Because I ended up taking so long, we got to church…as the service finished. Well done me. Ach well…I stocked up with lucozade sport, and mars bars, and proceeded to make the journey back. Which I managed with only 1 stop, in an hour. Not too bad, I must say so myself.

So yeah, interesting week it was.

Until next time.

Ok, I used to do this thing on my Myspace page where I would have a Video of the Month. So I decided I would do it on here, just cause.

This weeks video has quite a few reasons why it is my Video of the Week.

1. I love the song  
2. They have such cool hair, and somehow they have the time to flick it out their eyes while still playing solos that I can only play on guitar hero on medium.  
3. I’m getting there at playing it on medium in Guitar Hero  
4. It is just soooooooo cool.  
5. Herman manages to break his whammy during the video, at the beginning of the cool solo bit.  
6. They have time to do things such as drink beer, flip drum sticks through their fingers and flick their hair, while playing this stuff.  
7. The cool dual solo bit, when one is playing and the other isn’t is just so cool.  
8. The band name, along with the song name are just immense.

So here we go, DragonForce with “Through the Fire and the Flames”

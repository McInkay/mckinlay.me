Before I talk about the video, I would like to announce that I will be AFK for about a week and a half. I am away on holiday, and I have no idea how much internet I will have. Sorry to dissapoint all ![:P](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

No, but seriously, I won’t be updating this for ages, and I won’t be on anywhere. Woop! I will have 1 loooong email list and Rss list. But these are the joys of going on holiday.

Anyway, the video. I didn’t have a video, so randomly in the #linuxoutlaws channel on freenode irc, I asked if anyone had a funny video, and this video was announced by [nailuj24](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Julian). Thank you very much ![:)](http://www.10people.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) anyways…on with the video.

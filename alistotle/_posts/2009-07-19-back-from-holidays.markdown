Welcome to the blog where I do not talk about sexism in the open source community,  or Mono and whether it is good or evil.

Well…I am back from the depths of the Lake District and the Scotland/England border. It was a fantastic holiday. We went to just outside Penrith for 4 days, spending the time geocaching, and eating, and just enjoying myself. Then we went to Oasis (sorry…Centre Parks…I still can’t get the hang of that) for the weekend, although I came back up on Friday evening for work on Saturday, and went back down in the evening.

On the Sunday, I went quad-biking, had an amazing meal at the Italian restaurant, and chilled. Monday we then travelled to Keilder. Now, you may not have heard of Keilder. Neither had I. But it turns out that Keilder is a very small village in the middle of a national park (called Keilder forest) at the top of a big reservoir (called Keilder water). It is placed aprox. 15 minutes from the Scottish border, pretty much in the middle of the country.

Keilder is a tiny little village with no phone signal, no free wifi, 1 shop (a convenience store), a youth hostel and hundreds and hundreds of cyclists, where we spend the week geocaching (however, without any internet or phone signal, my geocache navigator app (which, btw, I will be blogging about soon) was kinda useless.

So, all in all, my holiday was quite an enjoyable 10 days of driving, walking and geocaching. It was really good, but I am glad to be back in civilisation with my internet.

Sorry about my lack of blogging recently, I’ve been doing lots of work for Uni, and will get back to blogging asap with a review of a certain piece of software. I will keep you in suspense as to what it is, but it is still in beta, and the linux version has only very recently been announced. It is closed source, but it is a very exciting piece of software. Anyway, on with this post…

Some of you may know newsboys. They are a huge Christian Rock band origionally from Australia but in America. And recently they got a new lead singer. This is their first single from the upcoming album in July of this year. This is so different to their new stuff, it is so exciting. The new singer, Michael, is actually one of the singers from DC Talk (an 80s christian hip-hop band), and this just seems fantastic. Anyway, enjoy
